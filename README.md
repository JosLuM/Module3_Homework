# Module3_Homework
 

## This is a README file related to the Jeu Pendu project

### A git repository was created containing the Jeu Pendu files required to execute the project in Pycharm

### The git folder is named  Module3_Homework and contains two files
### One is a .py file that contains the code for the Jeu Pendu (Jeu_Pendu.py)
### The other is a .txt file that contains the list of all the words that Jeu_Pendu can use (mots_pendu.txt)

### Jeu_pendu is essentially a word guessing game. It prompts to the user to enter a letter
### Then, the program will look in the mots_pendu.txt file for a match.
### The purpose of the game is that user provides letter by letter until the full word is completed
### There are a number of attempts the user should not exceed in order to sucessfully complete the game
